# CVR/FDR Analyzer

A single-page React application for aviation investigators to review cockpit voice recorder (CVR) and flight data recorder (FDR) cases. The dashboard surfaces high-level activity, provides quick entry points to case work, and links to focused tooling for timeline review, audio playback, correlation, and reporting.

## Features

- **Investigator dashboard** – Visualizes monthly incident/accident trends, maps case locations, and highlights recently accessed cases for quick follow-up.
- **Case workspace** – Navigate through pending investigations, drill into case details, and jump directly to CVR, FDR, correlation, and reporting tools.
- **Data correlation tools** – Dedicated views for pairing CVR transcripts with FDR parameters and producing shareable reports.
- **Responsive layout** – Built with Tailwind CSS and Lucide icons for a polished experience on desktop and tablet form factors.

## Prerequisites

Before installing the project dependencies ensure that you have the following software available locally:

- **Node.js** 18.0.0 or later (Node 20.x LTS recommended)
- **npm** 9.x or later (ships with Node.js)
- **PostgreSQL** 13 or later (for the case management API)

If you plan to exercise the MinIO-backed attachment workflow you will also need:

- **MinIO Server** (latest stable release) or another S3-compatible implementation
- **MinIO Client (mc)** for bucket administration (optional but recommended)

You can verify your toolchain with:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

## One-time setup

Install the project dependencies by running the helper script provided in this repository:

```bash
./install-requirements.sh
```

The script verifies that Node.js and npm are available before running `npm install` to pull in the dependencies listed in `package.json`.

> **Note**: If you prefer to install dependencies manually, you can run `npm install` in the project root.

## MinIO object storage setup

The backend integrates with an S3-compatible object store (MinIO by default) to host uploaded CVR/FDR files. Follow the steps below
to configure a local instance that mirrors the production workflow:

1. **Install MinIO**

   - **Docker (recommended for local testing):**

     ```bash
     docker run \
       -p 9000:9000 \
       -p 9001:9001 \
       -e MINIO_ROOT_USER=fdradmin \
       -e MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD=supersecret123 \
       quay.io/minio/minio server /data --console-address :9001
     ```

   - **Native installation:** Download the latest release from [min.io](https://min.io/download#/linux) and follow the
     platform-specific instructions. Ensure the service listens on `http://127.0.0.1:9000` for development.

2. **Install the MinIO client (optional but helpful)**

   ```bash
   brew install minio/stable/mc    # macOS
   # or
   curl -fsSL https://dl.min.io/client/mc/release/linux-amd64/mc -o /usr/local/bin/mc && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/mc
   ```

3. **Create a bucket for recorder data**

   ```bash
   mc alias set local http://127.0.0.1:9000 fdradmin supersecret123
   mc mb local/fdr-cvr-data
   ```

   The API will reuse the bucket if it already exists, so you only need to provision it once.

4. **Configure environment variables** – Update `server/.env` with your MinIO endpoint and credentials (see
   [`server/.env.example`](server/.env.example)). The key variables are:

   ```bash
   MINIO_ENDPOINT=http://127.0.0.1:9000
   MINIO_ACCESS_KEY=fdradmin
   MINIO_SECRET_KEY=supersecret123
   MINIO_REGION=us-east-1
   MINIO_BUCKET=fdr-cvr-data
   ```

   Optional overrides include `MINIO_USE_SSL`, `MINIO_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`, and the upload/download expiry timers.

5. **Verify connectivity** – Start the API with `npm run server`. The service performs a `HeadBucket` call and will create the
   bucket automatically if it is missing (useful when pointing at a fresh environment).

Once configured, the dashboard will upload FDR/CVR attachments directly to MinIO and persist the object keys in PostgreSQL.

## Running the application

1. **Provision the database**

   ```bash
   createdb cvr_fdr_analyzer
   ```

   The API automatically applies `server/db/schema.sql` on startup, so you only need to create the empty
   database once.

2. **Configure the API** – Copy `.env.example` and update the connection string if needed:

   ```bash
   cp server/.env.example server/.env
   ```

3. **Install backend dependencies** (run once per environment):

   ```bash
   npm install --prefix server
   ```

4. **Start the API server**:

   ```bash
   npm run server
   ```

   The REST API listens on [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) and exposes CRUD endpoints under `/api/cases`.

5. **Start the React app** in a second terminal:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The UI runs at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and proxies API requests to the backend.

## Building for production

Create an optimized production bundle in the `build/` directory:

```bash
npm run build
```

The output bundle is tree-shaken, minified, and ready to be deployed to your hosting platform of choice.

## Testing

Run the Create React App test runner in watch mode:

```bash
npm test
```

```

## Viewing the documentation

Architecture notes and diagrams live in the `docs/` folder as Markdown files. You can view them directly in GitHub or any IDE
with Markdown preview support. For Mermaid diagrams, export a shareable image or PDF with the Mermaid CLI:

```bash
npx -y @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli -i docs/cvr-fdr-workflow-diagram.md -o docs/cvr-fdr-workflow.png
```

The command above writes a rendered diagram to `docs/cvr-fdr-workflow.png`. Feel free to change the output file extension (for
example, `.pdf`) to match the format you need.

## Available scripts

| Command | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `npm start` | Runs the app in development mode with hot reload. |
| `npm test` | Launches the unit test runner in watch mode. |
| `npm run build` | Generates a production-optimized build. |
| `npm run eject` | Copies CRA configuration locally (irreversible). |
| `npm run server` | Starts the Express API on port 4000. |

## Troubleshooting

- **Port already in use**: The CRA dev server defaults to port 3000. Set `PORT=3001` (or another free port) before running `npm start` to use a different port.
- **Dependency issues**: Delete the `node_modules/` directory and rerun `./install-requirements.sh`.
- **Unsupported Node.js version**: Upgrade to the latest Active LTS release of Node.js.
- **"Unexpected server error" responses**: Run `npm run server` in a terminal to keep the API logs visible. The backend now prints the stack trace for unhandled errors and, when `NODE_ENV` is not set to `production`, also returns the specific error message in the JSON response (`details` field) so you can see the root cause directly in the browser network tab.
